# Intention-Timer

## Abstract

- The purpose of this project was to create a countdown timer for activities. The input includes a selection between 3 broad categories (study, meditate, exercise), a description of the activity, and values for minutes and seconds. These values are then passed to a section containing the description, countdown clock, and start button. Activities should be able to be logged/stored in a separate section with the same values. Once logged, the user should have an option to create a new activity.

## Technology Used

- The languages used for this project are HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
